    "id": 41,
    "prompt": "The non-striving time of striving people. How many striving people are there in the world? Hot days, cold days, days with rain and wind where umbrellas are useless, snowy days that stop trains. People striving for company, for family, and for themselves. I want to give such people time not to strive. Time not striving exists for the next time of striving."

Those hands are making someone happy. You are making someone happy. Caring for hands is praising your hardworking self. Let's praise working hands."

    "id": 44,
    "prompt": "Not smart ways of living, but I wish everyone could be happy. Not shopping while worrying about points, but I wish points would naturally accrue on what I want. Not bound by the word 'bargain', I wish I could live with a free heart."
  },
  {
    "id": 45,
    "prompt": "I am me. This year you get one year older. Every time, boring words like 'act your age' try to bind you. You don't need to listen. The eyes of the world always change later."
  },
  {
    "id": 46,
    "prompt": "It's spring. A slightly newer world than usual is about to begin. The daily comings and goings with refreshing expressions will likely expand more. That everyday life is surely supremely beautiful. Whether worrying, looking forward, standing still, stepping forward, crying together, or laughing together, everyone has a good face."
  },
  {
    "id": 47,
    "prompt": "People grow in summer. Just as sunflowers surpass a person's height before you know it, some people's faces change completely in one summer. Even though it's hot enough to exhaust you just by moving, people fall in love, devote themselves to sports, burn with work, go on trips. Summer might be the season that grows humans the most in a year."
  },
  {
    "id": 48,
    "prompt": "If love is to end, summer is best. An end comes to love someday. Sweet love, sad love, I don't even want to think about it ending, but the end comes someday. If the end is unavoidable, rather than cherry blossom spring, sunset-hardening autumn, or skin-longing winter, I prefer the annoyingly bright summer."
  },
  {
    "id": 49,
    "prompt": "Come to think of it, best friends and lovers were once strangers. Thinking back, until just a few years ago, that person was a stranger whose name I didn't even know. To think we'd get this close. It's strange. Respecting, being jealous, causing trouble, being troubled. Encounters teach me many things. And such experiences make the current me. Me without you is not me."

    "prompt": "You can't buy affection with money, but you can put affection into money. You can breathe life into it. If money is used for a loved one."
  },
  {
    "id": 52,
    "prompt": "Let's praise someone we dislike. Different so interesting. Different so perspective widens. Different so we can grow. What's important is the heart to think of and acknowledge each other. Won't you try finding good points in someone you dislike? We believe the world changes little by little from such small kindness. Because we are different, people think of people."
  },
  {
    "id": 53,
    "prompt": "The most important thing is being friends. Because that is a close joy, let's be friends. Let's be strength when needed. Laugh at silly jokes. Want to surprise. Want to be together. Want to share everything. Your friend must want to do the same as you. Just being there is enough, friend. Are you someone's friend?"
  },
  {
    "id": 54,
    "prompt": "I think the phrase 'light person' is surely a compliment. If the burden on shoulders becomes light, you can go further forward than before. When worrying alone, if there is a friend who makes it light, you can laugh together. Surely being light is an important element for humans."
  },
  {
    "id": 55,
    "prompt": "Please picture someone you trust from the bottom of your heart. Is that person a Yes-man? We sometimes tell customers things that are painful to hear. There may be a thought that customers' words should not be denied. However, as long as we have the responsibility to protect precious assets for a long time, we will speak properly about what needs to be spoken. We believe true advice is like that."

  },
  {
    "id": 58,
    "prompt": "Not love to reach a goal, not love to brag to friends, not love tracing an old love, not love where one becomes unhappy, not love thinking of someone in silence, but probably because life is more fun for two than one."
  },
  {
    "id": 59,
    "prompt": "Actually, I'm afraid of myself losing to distance. Knowing that, I want to burn the fact that I met you today somewhere in my body and mind. I want to be touching your shoulder. I want to be touching your lips. Tested by distance, the two become strong."
  },

    "id": 60,

  {
    "id": 61,
    "prompt": "A name might be the first letter parents send to their child. Because it's only one or two characters, parents worry. Hope you grow up like this. No, if you're healthy, that's enough. Anyway, thank you for being born. With overflowing feelings in heart, facing the paper. Moving the pen while talking to the life in the belly. Writing again and again, thinking again and again, writing again. A name given preciously that way. I think that is one letter sent from parents to the child."

    "prompt": "When eating alone, don't you wish that person was by your side? When eating alone, don't you want to cook for someone? When eating alone, don't you think it's just the act of eating? Family, dietary education, peace, love are at the dining table."
  },
  {
    "id": 63,
    "prompt": "Happiness is where rice is cooked. When eating, we want people to be happy. We sincerely think so. Even when alone, even when eating hurriedly, even when having a lot of work, and of course when with a loved one. Because eating is the most important thing for people to live."
  },
  {
    "id": 64,
    "prompt": "All memories are made of people, time, and places. Seeing that izakaya reminds me of my office colleague. Seeing that Japanese restaurant reminds me of love talk with friends. Seeing that Italian place reminds me of my first blind date. Seeing that hair salon reminds me of waiting before a date. Seeing that cooking class reminds me of wanting to get married. Seeing that cafe reminds me of looking for the next restaurant to go to with my husband."
  },
  {
    "id": 65,
    "prompt": "Living for others. That might be living happily. I thought about that recently. For someone whose name I don't know, for someone whose face I don't know. People who live like that look helplessly beautiful. Is it because I got old? But after realizing that, I also think maybe we can still make this world a comfortable place."
  },
  {
    "id": 66,
    "prompt": "Each person's climax begins. If moments pile up to make a lifetime, I want those to be beautiful moments. Cherishing joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure, believing the voice of body and mind, and living happily as a result. By collecting such moments, life might increase in beauty and continue on. Beautifully for a moment, beautifully for a lifetime."
  },
  {
    "id": 67,
    "prompt": "Let's fall in love. Everyone, let's fall in love. Let's come to like someone. And let's come to like ourselves. Everyone, let's fall in love. Because it makes the world new. Because you might come to like songs you didn't know. Because food might become delicious. Because it might change the meaning of deep breaths. Because it teaches the sadness of lies. Because even if it ends, it surely leaves something behind."
  },
  {
    "id": 68,

  },
  {
    "id": 70,
    "prompt": "Show them. Potential power(Guts). Done what could be done. Didn't run away. Yes, effort that you can feel from the bottom of your heart and gut is what people call latent power. It's okay. You didn't run away."

    "id": 71,

  },
  {
    "id": 72,
    "prompt": "Creating forms from thoughts without being bound by set common sense or rules. What future society needs is such people. How about you? You should be able to do anything. Don't end up just being someone."
  },
  {
    "id": 73,
    "prompt": "The magnitude of beauty. What is beauty? For you, for humans, for the world, what use is beauty? Knowledge alone is not education. Humans are not hard disks."
  },
  {
    "id": 74,
    "prompt": "Someone drew a line first. Eventually it became a border. Humans are strange. Just drawing one line on a map creates walls and causes conflicts. Gender, language, cultural differences. The more we are conscious of differences, the higher the walls become. What we are looking for is someone who can work without being bound by frameworks. Someone who sees the essence and works to make society better. Make the world more wonderful than now. We want to meet people who resonate with that thought."
  },

  },
  {
    "id": 76,
    "prompt": "To you who have only possibilities. You who feel you aren't showing your power yet. That is correct. The limits of human ability are not yet known. We don't know how much power lies dormant within you. We only know that latent potential is drawn out when body and mind are balanced. You are surely beyond imagination."
  },
  {
    "id": 77,
    "prompt": "Aren't you setting your own limits? Aren't you bound by past common sense? Because the future isn't inside the boxes (frames) that existed until now. We can become anything. We can go anywhere. Don't get stuck in a mold."
  },

    "id": 78,
    "prompt": "If you do nothing, nothing happens. If you don't go, it won't come. If you don't jump out, the world won't change. Everyone has wings in their heart. To use them or not. The world is waiting. To fly or not. Let's cross the sea. Let's cross words. Let's cross yesterday. Let's fly in the sky."
  },
  {
    "id": 79,
    "prompt": "There is a hint in 'cannot do'. Pursuing someone's inability leads to finding everyone's ability. It must be okay. Everyone should be able to do it. Such optimism is common. But that is also the cause of creating things that are hard to use when actually used. The important thing is to stand on the premise that inability is natural, and aim for 'anyone can do it'."
  },
  {
    "id": 81,
    "prompt": "It is always curiosity that drives us. You can't make a living just doing what you like. But if you don't do what you like, life is boring. I do it because it's interesting."
  },
  {
    "id": 82,
    "prompt": "Those who live in the now are the strongest. An era where everything is predicted by calculation. Now the world factors in the future, and people live the present by caculating backwards from the future, but does that count as living in the now? A predictable future only shrinks our potential. Those who immersed themselves in something enough to forget time, and poured all their passion into this moment, are the ones who changed the era. Shohei Ohtani is also one of them. Let's also live this moment with full power. Because the present doesn't exist for the future, but the future exists at the end of cherishing the present."
  },

    "id": 83,
    "prompt": "Blue dances. As if dreams are chasing us. As if time is chasing us. Run, run, let's keep running. The voice of the beginning is ringing. As if dreams are chasing us. As if time is chasing us. Run, run. It tastes like being alive."
  },
  {
    "id": 84,
    "prompt": "Humans cannot fly. So we made wings called airplanes. Humans are weak. So we made bonds called society. Humans are incomplete. That's why we face various challenges and try to create an ideal tomorrow. Only humans dream with their eyes open."
  },
  {
    "id": 85,
    "prompt": "Let's do what we can't do together. Without running away, without giving up. Let's do what we can't do together. There isn't just one path. There isn't just one answer. Let's do what we can't do together. What you wish for. What the world wishes for. Let's do what we can't do together. For the people living in the future."
  },
  {
    "id": 86,
    "prompt": "Living. That is fighting against many things. The biggest enemy is my own heart that gives up. Yesterday exists for today. I see. Thank you. Me of yesterday."
  },
  {
    "id": 87,
    "prompt": "'Let's have a dream,' adults say. I think so too. It's definitely better to have a goal. I envy people who are absorbed in what they like. But thinking about it, we've only lived 20 years and a bit. There are still many unknown worlds and new encounters. What I like and what suits me. Being vague about that might be extremely natural. I go at my own speed. Yes, it's okay to find a dream while running."
  },
  {
    "id": 88,
    "prompt": "My first part-time job was at McDonald's. The first time I smiled at a stranger, the first time I was praised by an adult other than family, the first time I made colleagues across generations, it was all at McDonald's where I first worked. What I gained then is still alive now. This experience is for a lifetime."
  },
  {
    "id": 89,
    "prompt": "Back then, you were still lost. Wanted to play more with friends. Wanted to be pampered more by mom and dad. Made mistakes many times, was sleepy, and even muttered about wanting to quit. Almost swallowed by compromise. But little by little, you stopped giving up. The experience of not giving up even then cannot be taken away by anyone for a lifetime."
  },
  {
    "id": 90,
    "prompt": "Nervousness and anxiety are proof that you have worked hard. I think the days you faced seriously until today have become the beating of your heart now. So it's okay. Take a deep breath."
  },

  },
  {
    "id": 92,
    "prompt": "The one who heard your true feelings the most was yourself. The one who watched your trials the most was yourself. The one who knew your efforts the most was yourself. The one who cheered for you the most was undoubtedly yourself."
  },
  {
    "id": 93,
    "prompt": "I can't wait for the next me. Time always heads to the future. Living this moment with all my might creates a new me. Like stacking one second at a time, step by step, I look forward to the next me."
  },
  {
    "id": 94,
    "prompt": "Let's make a path. When the world was born, there must have been no paths there. If many people walk, those footprints eventually become a path. Many setbacks, many happinesses, many resolutions, and many passions become many footprints, and someday they become a path. Let's make a path."
  },
  {
    "id": 95,
    "prompt": "Listen to the voice of the future. The future doesn't appear suddenly. As everyone's thoughts and wishes take shape little by little, it becomes a world different from before. That's why we are always listening. To the voices from half a year later, 10 years later, 50 years later, and sometimes from further ahead."
  },
  {
    "id": 96,
    "prompt": "Excitement creates the future. Curiosity changes the world. The next common sense is born from nonsense (extraordinary)."
  },
  {
    "id": 97,
    "prompt": "Nothing is decided yet. Move, crash. The more you overcome the impossible, the better and stronger you can become. As long as you keep challenging, there is no defeat. After tomorrow, 7 years later. Who you become is decided by you today."
  },
  {
    "id": 98,
    "prompt": "Enviably, you can still choose your life. Dreams should be big. If it's now, you can still become any kind of adult. It's a waste to make a mold. I think believing that you can do it if you try is the first step."
  },
  {
    "id": 99,
    "prompt": "There are days when things don't go well. Days when you get exhausted. Days when you get embarrassed. Days when you get angry, but that is all proof that you lived today with all your might."
